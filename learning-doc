===== UI =====
*	Product Quantity
-Quantity has no min-max value. Negative and extremely large numbers can be entered and still added to cart.
-The total price reflects negative number values. (ex. if quantity = -1 and price = 400, cart will show -400)
-Extremely large quantity numbers cause elements to completely shift
-An order can be placed if quantity is set to 0 which will allow the item to be bought for $0
-Quantity cannot be changed in the cart, only in the View Product page

*	Product Category
-The category of a product is not shown in the all products list, but does in the View Product page.

*	Checkout
-Checkout page can be accessed when no product is in cart by navigating directly to /checkout. 
-An order can also be placed successfully even with nothing to checkout.
-Checkout can be accessed when not logged in.
-If a user logs out at checkout screen, then navigates backwards they are still logged in and can place the order.
